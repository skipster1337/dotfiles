# bin
Small folder of scripts I use on my system. Stuff like preventing the system from going to sleep, getting Spotify to open without hardware acceleration and displaying Spotify status in i3bar (props to [i3spotifystatus](https://github.com/rpieja/i3spotifystatus)).

Rofi power menu script is from [here](https://github.com/jluttine/rofi-power-menu/blob/master/rofi-power-menu).

If you're wondering, I use [spotify-adblock](https://github.com/abba23/spotify-adblock) as you could probably tell from the shortcut.
