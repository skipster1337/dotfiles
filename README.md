# Dotfiles
Simple pack of dotfiles for my Linux desktop. Mostly made to work with i3 and Openbox, and themes such as [Fluent](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Fluent-gtk-theme) and Arc-Dark.
Here you will find configs for i3 (and i3bar and i3status), openbox, tint2, conky, rofi, dunst and much more.
You might need the Cantarell and MesloLGS NF fonts for this to work properly.

# Structure
This repo contains configs of various stages of completion: the first batch is made for Arc-Dark, the second is for Fluent-Grey, and the third and current one is for Fluent-Red. I don't work as much on my older configs, solely because I don't use them.

# Credits
- Conky configs are modified from [BunsenLabs](https://www.bunsenlabs.org/)
- Picom config based off [this one](https://github.com/Sup3r-Us3r/MyDotfiles/blob/master/.config/picom/picom.conf)
- Rofi theme is a heavily edited version of [Darker than Black v2](https://github.com/avasz/rofi-themes-avasz)
