# Dotfiles
Simple pack of dotfiles for my Linux desktop. Mostly made to work with i3 and Openbox, and themes such as [Fluent](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Fluent-gtk-theme) and Arc-Dark.
Here you will find configs for i3 (and i3bar and i3status), openbox, tint2, conky, rofi, dunst and much more.

# Structure
This repo contains configs of various stages of completion: the first batch is made for Arc-Dark, the second is for Fluent-Grey, and the third and current one is for Fluent-Red. I don't work as much on my older configs, solely because I don't use them.  
I also have configs for Debian to replicate the Openbox environment of Crunchbang, made to work with Bunsen-Faenza icons and the Bunsen-He theme.  
On Openbox I use the [Openbox Applications Menu](https://github.com/Lestibournes/Openbox-Applicatons-Menu) for my pipe menu because it's easy to install and configure.

# Fonts  
Here are all the main fonts used in these configs:  
- In my Fluent rice I use Cantarell for the UI,  MesloLGS NF for the terminal and ZSH, Open Sans i3bar and FontAwesome 6 for icons in i3bar (optional, uncomment lines in config and i3status to enable).
- For my Debian rice I use FreeSans for the UI, Lato Black for the titlebars, and Noto Mono for the terminal and monospace font.

# Credits
- Conky configs are modified from [BunsenLabs](https://www.bunsenlabs.org/)
- Picom config based off [this one](https://github.com/Sup3r-Us3r/MyDotfiles/blob/master/.config/picom/picom.conf)
- Rofi theme is a heavily edited version of [Darker than Black v2](https://github.com/avasz/rofi-themes-avasz)
